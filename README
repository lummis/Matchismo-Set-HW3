Stanford course CS193p HW3 - Matchismo&Set

Everything in the basic assignment is done except the set card shading is done
with with alpha = 0.3 instead of stripes. None of the extra credit things are done.

The set card view was copied from Marko Kuljanski's solution (thank you Marko) except
that I replaced his drawSquiggle method with my own because I wanted a different look
for the squiggles.

The screens could be laid out a little better but they look ok and device rotation works. 

I guess a lot of things could be improved but I'm really tired of working
on this project and anxious to move on to the next lecture and the next HW
so I'm not going to tinker with it any more.

I found the names he used for the classes annoyingly similar to each other, which is one reason I didn't like the project.
